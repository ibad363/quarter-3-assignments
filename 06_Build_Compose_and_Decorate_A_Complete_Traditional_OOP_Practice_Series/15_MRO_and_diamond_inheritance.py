# 15. Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance
# Assignment:
# Create four classes:

# A with a method show(),
# B and C that inherit from A and override show(),
# D that inherits from both B and C.
# Create an object of D and call show() to observe MRO.

class A:
    def show(self):
        print("A")

class B(A):
    def show(self):
        print("B")

class C(A):
    def show(self):
        print("C")

class D(B, C):
    pass

# Test
d = D()
d.show()
print(D.__mro__)
