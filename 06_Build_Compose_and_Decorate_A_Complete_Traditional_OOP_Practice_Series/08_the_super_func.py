# 8. The super() Function
# Assignment:
# Create a class Person with a constructor that sets the name. Inherit a class Teacher from it, add a subject field, and use super() to call the base class constructor.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


class Teacher:
    def __init__(self, name, subject):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.subject = subject
        
# Create an instance of Teacher
teacher = Teacher("Alice", "Mathematics")
print(f"Name: {teacher.name}, Subject: {teacher.subject}")
# Output: Name: Alice, Subject: Mathematics
